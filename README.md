# Predicting Employee Churn

Human resource capital is one of the cogs that play a vital role in an organization's success. Every year a lot of companies hire a number of employees. The companies invest time and money in training those employees, not just this but there are training programs within the companies for their existing employees as well.

Having said that, employee attrition leads to significant costs for a business, including the cost of business disruption, hiring new staff and training new staff. A major problem in high employee attrition is its cost to an organization. Job postings, hiring processes, paperwork and new hire training are some of the common expenses of losing employees and replacing them. Additionally, regular employee turnover prohibits your organization from increasing its collective knowledge base and experience over time. This is especially concerning if your business is customer facing, as customers often prefer to interact with familiar people.

As such, there is great business interest in understanding the drivers of, and minimizing staff attrition. While some level of attrition in a company is inevitable, minimizing it and being prepared for the cases that cannot be helped will significantly help improve the operations of most businesses. In pursuit of solving this real-world problem, let's conduct some statistical analysis on employee data of an organization to find out which factors are driving the attrition. To augment, let's build a prediction model to identify employees who are likely to quit and enable HRs to intervene with human element of reaching out to employee, understanding the current situation of the employee and taking action to remedy controllable factors that can prevent attrition of the employee.
